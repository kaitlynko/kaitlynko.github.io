      <h2>Webb deVlam</h2>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>In the spring of my sophomore year (2018), I worked as a Mechanical Engineering Design Intern at <a href="http://www.webbdevlam.com/transition-to-new-markswdv-website" target="_blank">Webb deVlam</a>, a packaging design consultancy in Chicago. My time at Webb was impactful in contextualizing my love for engineering and design and showing me just how powerful an effective collaboration between the two worlds can be.</p>

    <p>This page summarizes a bit of my experience, but as you can imagine, it is hard to condense 6 months into one webpage while also honoring confidentiality agreements. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:kaitlynko2020@u.northwestern.edu">reach out to me</a> if you wish to further discuss my experience!</p>

      <h3>so what did i work on?</h3>
      <p id="summaryblurb">I think the coolest part about my time at Webb deVlam was just the sheer variety of projects and companies that I was exposed to.</p>
      <p id="summaryblurb">From cannabis to kids juice pouches and everything in between, I got to see it all. With such a diverse clientele, I had the opportunity to work on projects for companies big and small.</p>

    <h4>most of the work i did can be categorized into 3 groups</h4>

      <p>This meant a lot of SolidWorks, Keyshot, 3D printing, folding boxes, and learning how to use ArtiosCAD (a packaging software used to create dielines for folded packaging)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row" id="workblurb2">
    <p>A lot of the work I did at Webb was focused around producing high quality work in a short amount of time. This meant a lot of quick 3D models and prints, large quantities of renders, and rapid prototyping but at a level of fidelity that could be shared with clients.</p>

<div class="container-fluid" id="BD">
  <p>One of my main projects I got to work on was designing the packaging for a new insulin delivery system by BD Diabetes Care. Throughout my 6 months, I was able to see this project go from initial ideation to production and played a part in all stages - 3D modeling, structure development, rendering, prototyping, research, and production. Since this product hasn’t gone to market yet (set to be released this winter!) I can’t share many pictures here, but I would be happy to share more of my work on this project in person.</p>

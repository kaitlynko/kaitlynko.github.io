        <h1>Precious Plastic NU</h1>
        <p id="subheader">my MechE capstone in partnership with Compass Group</p>
        <p id="introblurb">I worked in a team with 7 other students to design & fabricate a plastic recycling center for Northwestern adapted from <a href="https://preciousplastic.com/" target="blank">Precious Plastic</a>. This project encompassed designing the system-level process, designing the components of the system, and fabricating those components.

        <h2>The Problem.</h2>
        <p>Our client, Sarah Levesque of Compass Group, came to us with the exciting idea for repurposing plastic waste at Northwestern. She was intrigued by the work that Precious Plastic was doing, and wanted to bring those ideas to life on our campus. However, this would not be as simple as gathering the plans Precious Plastic provides and building machines. The machines and processes of Precious Plastic had to be adapted to fit the needs of Northwestern.</p>

        <h2>Defining Challenges.</h2>
        <p>In tackling a project of such large scope, we were faced with many challenges. Here were some of our most defining challenges:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Defining project scope</li>
          <li>Adapting Precious Plastic machines to incorporate safety measures approved by risk management</li>
          <li>Cleaning plastic waste</li>
          <li>Fabricating machines in an interative process</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Machines.</h2>
        <p>We identified our process' critical system to be 2 parts - the shredding & cleaning of the plastic. Without clean, processed plastic, there would be no end product. In the end, we decided that our forming machine recommendation would be Precious Plastic's extruder because of its versatility in creating stock materials. So, we needed to build 3 machines - a shredder, extruder, and cleaner - and integrate them into 1 system.</p>
        <p>The shredder and extruder were to be built primarily following the instructional materials provided by Precious Plastic. However, since Precious Plastic is modeled after sourcing already clean plastic and does not offer a developed cleaning system, our cleaner needed to be designed and built from scratch.</p>

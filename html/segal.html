        <h1>DIY Diabetes</h1>
        <p id="subheader">modular learning tool for newly diagnosed diabetes patients</p>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to design and manufacture diabetes kits and instructional materials to train newly diagnosed diabetes patients and their caretakers to treat diabetes at home.</p>
        <p>A previous team had designed a kit with instructional materials and manufactured 5 of these kits. In this phase of the project, we were tasked with improving that existing design and manufacturing 30 kits to be used in a clinical study.</p>

        <h2>Requirements & Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>intuitive to use</li>
          <li>easy to use even with limited dexterity, strength, and vision</li>
          <li>accommodates users of ages 20-70</li>
          <li>must manufacture 30 kits in-house (limited to resources of Ford Prototyping Shop)</li>
          <li>cost of materials per kit < $25</li>

      <h2>Design Development</h2>
        <p>Using my packaging experience from my time at Webb deVlam, I came up with a few dieline designs.
        <p>I came up with a standard assembly procedure for the box and adapted fabrication methods within the capabilities of Northwestern's Ford Prototyping Shop. Instead of using a CAD cutting table (traditionally used in packaging), paper and chipboard were cut on the CO2 laser cutter. Since we didn't have a machine to apply adhesive to the paper, this step was performed by hand.</p>

      <div class="col-md-5" id="assemblytext">
        <p>Since we needed to manufacture 30 kits and each kit is comprised of 4 boxes (1 box for each step), we needed to fabricate a total of 120 boxes. I worked on this project with 2 other interns, and after teaching them my method for fabrication, we were able to construct all 120 boxes within a few weeks - including vac-formed inserts and instructional materials.</p>

        <h2>Final Design</h2>
        <p>The final kit design is comprised of 4 boxes that stack magnetically. The boxes close via a magnet flap and a velcro carrying strap allows for easy transport. The magnets allow for a sophisticated presentation and satisfying tactile feedback when the boxes are properly secured and closed.</p>
        <h3>KEY DESIGN FEATURES</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2-layer, paper living hinge is meant to hold up against repeated use</li>
          <li>Laminate coating on the paper allows the boxes to be cleaned with disinfecting wipes</li>
          <li>Magnets are strong enough to keep the kit secure while being weak enough that patients with limited strength do not struggle</li>
          <li>Magnets ensure accuracy and consistency with repeated disassembly/assembly of the kit during use</li>
        </ul>

    <p>The intersection of fashion & function</p>
    <p class="overview">In a freshman design course, I worked in a team with 3 of my peers to design & create a<span class="bold"> multi-touch stylus</span> solution for our client - a woman with spastic cerebral palsy. The project was done in partnership with the <span class="bold"><a href="https://www.sralab.org/" target="_blank">Shirley Ryan AbilityLab</a></span>. Below is the general outline of the project and a little background on how we reached the final design.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <h3>The Problem.</h3>
      <p>People with spastic cerebral palsy often have limited hand function and have difficulty performing multi-touch functions on touch-screen devices. We were challenged to design a device that would allow people affected by spastic cerebral palsy with limited hand function to use a touchscreen device with increased comfort and ease. Specifically, we set out to create a multi-touch stylus that our client could use with her iPad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="requirements">
      <h4>Requirements.</h4>
      <p>We determined the following 4 main requirements of our design:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Functional</span> must have dual-touch capabilities and be compatible with the user's touch-screen device</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Comfortable</span> must provide a pain free experience</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Convenient</span> must not involve additional gear requiring installation & must be easily stored in user's wheelchair</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Durable</span> must not require frequent maintenance & should serve its purpose without diminished quality for a minimum of 1 year</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
